## Overview
The project that I am doing is a portfolio allowing students to insert their past personal achievements and awards. It allows them to be able to look back on what they achieved previously and it also allows them to be scouted easily as it is online and they can be found.

## Design Process:
As a user, it allows me, the user, to get to know more about my applicant's details. 
Example, their resume, skills, qualification/work history, portfolio on previous works and projects. It also allows me to contact them via different ways.

## Features:
Social Media Icon 
 - Website are interlink to other personal social media platform

Download CV button 
- allowing user to download my resume pdf version

Scroll reveal animation 
- allowing more motion in the webpage (not so plain)

Message fill up boxes 
- sllow user to fill in thier details and submit it when clicking the send message button

Side button 
- allow user to go up all the way to home page without scrolling all the way

## Features Left to Implement:
